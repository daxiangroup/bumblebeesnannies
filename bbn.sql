20:33:59','2012-11-19 20:33:59','Sometimes sharing a nanny might be the best option for your family – a more affordable alternative!\r\n\r\nWhen two families come together to share a nanny for their children, this is called a “Nanny Share”.\r\n\r\n<strong>Option 1:</strong> The nanny can care for both sets of children on all days Monday- Friday. There is usually only 1 child from each family in this option.\r\n<strong>Option 2:</strong> The nanny alternates between caring for one family’s children on one day, and the other family’s children on the other days.\r\n<div class=\"divider div3\"></div>\r\nWith a nanny share, the families involved should have the same philosophies on parenting, routines, discipline, etc. In most nanny shares, the involved families have one child each. Nanny share nannies usually work between 45- 50 hours per week.\r\n\r\nMany families would like to alternate between the two houses, 1-2 weeks in each home. This can unsettle the children and disrupt their routine. Consistency is very important for young children. It can also disrupt the nannies schedule especially when children’s items are left at the other home eg favourite toy, winter hats and gloves, sunscreen, bottles.\r\n<h4>Points to consider when starting a Nanny Share</h4>\r\n<ul class=\"styled\">\r\n	<li>The household where the children will be based will need to have an extra sleeping area and bed (pack and play)</li>\r\n	<li>The cost of children’s groceries will need to be halved ie. milk, food, diapers, wipes</li>\r\n	<li>Transport for two children, whether it be two car seats or a double stroller if needed.</li>\r\n	<li>Transporting your child’s bottles every morning and afternoon or buying an extra set for the other house</li>\r\n	<li>For the house that is having the children that there will be more toys, bottles, plates, cups in your home.</li>\r\n	<li>When the nanny gets vacations which would work for both families. Most nannies get between 2 weeks’ vacation and the days between Christmas and New Year. For the two weeks I always recommend that the families pick one week and the nanny picks the other week to make it fair.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Positives of being a part of a Nanny share</h4>\r\n<ul class=\"styled\">\r\n	<li>Sharing the cost of the nanny ages/ salary</li>\r\n	<li>The children learn to socialize with children their own age</li>\r\n	<li>Develop a close friendship with the other child</li>\r\n	<li>The children learn to share and participate with each other.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"controls\"><button class=\"btn\" onclick=\"document.location=\'families-sharing\';\">Looking For A Family</button><button class=\"btn\" onclick=\"document.location=\'families-looking\';\">Families With A Nanny To Share</button></div>','Nanny Share Family Finder','','publish','open','open','','nanny-share','','','2012-12-03 02:26:15','2012-12-03 02:26:15','',0,'http://localhost/bumblebees/?page_id=115',0,'page','',0),(116,1,'2012-11-19 20:33:41','2012-11-19 20:33:41','Welcome to the new Nanny Share Family Finder.

There is usually only 1 child from each family in this option.\n<strong>Option 2:</strong> The nanny alternates between caring for one family’s children on one day, and the other family’s children on the other days.\n<div class=\"divider div3\"></div>\nWith a nanny share, the families involved should have the same philosophies on parenting, routines, discipline, etc. In most nanny shares, the involved families have one child each. Nanny share nannies usually work between 45- 50 hours per week.\n\nMany families would like to alternate between the two houses, 1-2 weeks in each home. This can unsettle the children and disrupt their routine. Consistency is very important for young children. It can also disrupt the nannies schedule especially when children’s items are left at the other home eg favourite toy, winter hats and gloves, sunscreen, bottles.\n<h4>Points to consider when starting a Nanny Share</h4>\n<ul class=\"styled\">\n	<li>The household where the children will be based will need to have an extra sleeping area and bed (pack and play)</li>\n	<li>The cost of children’s groceries will need to be halved ie. milk, food, diapers, wipes</li>\n	<li>Transport for two children, whether it be two car seats or a double stroller if needed.</li>\n	<li>Transporting your child’s bottles every morning and afternoon or buying an extra set for the other house</li>\n	<li>For the house that is having the children that there will be more toys, bottles, plates, cups in your home.</li>\n	<li>When the nanny gets vacations which would work for both families. Most nannies get between 2 weeks’ vacation and the days between Christmas and New Year. For the two weeks I always recommend that the families pick one week and the nanny picks the other week to make it fair.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Positives of being a part of a Nanny share</h4>\n<ul class=\"styled\">\n	<li>Sharing the cost of the nanny ages/ salary</li>\n	<li>The children learn to socialize with children their own age</li>\n	<li>Develop a close friendship with the other child</li>\n	<li>The children learn to share and participate with each other.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"controls\"><button class=\"btn\" onclick=\"document.location=\'families-sharing\';\">Families With A Shared Nanny</button><button class=\"btn\" onclick=\"document.location=\'families-looking\';\">Families Looking For A Shared Nanny</button></div>','Nanny Share Family Finder','','inherit','open','open','','115-autosave','','','2012-12-03 01:54:24','2012-12-03 01:54:24','',115,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/115-autosave/',0,'revision','',0),(138,1,'2012-11-19 20:40:22','2012-11-19 20:40:22','Welcome to the new Nanny Share Family Finder.

Most of the qualified and experienced nannies are Live-out nannies; they have their own homes, families to go back to at the end of each day.\r\n\r\n<strong>3.

Nanny Trials</strong>\r\n\r\nRichelle recommends a trial so that the family can see the nanny interact with the children and family and for the nanny to see how the parents interact with their children. It should be a relaxing time, so the nanny can settle in and feel comfortable. It is recommended that the family pay the nanny for this time, minimum wage and last between 3-4 hours or to 4-5 days, depending on how well you feel it is going.\r\n\r\n<strong>8.

What your family needs from a childcare professional</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li> Do you need someone to help solely with your children or also run errands?</li>\r\n	<li>Do you need an extra pair of hands around the house to help with the children?</li>\r\n	<li>Does the child care professional need to be active and young at heart?</li>\r\n	<li>How many years experience would you like the nanny to have?</li>\r\n	<li>Is a driver necessary for school runs, after school activities or play dates?</li>\r\n	<li>Full or part time?</li>\r\n	<li>Would both parents be at work during the day so you need a very qualified nanny, with great communication skills?</li>\r\n	<li>Would you like your caregiver to have the same interests as you or your children?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>2. Shall I hire a Live-In or Live-Out Nanny?</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Live-In Nanny</strong>: The salary of a live-in nanny is lower because the food and accommodation is taken into account and there is extra room to accommodate the nanny (bedroom, living area, bathroom - which can be shared with the children). If a nanny lives with you, they need to have access to the kitchen and most areas of the house, tehy become a part of the family and a close bond with the nanny and family is usually developed quite quickly.\r\n\r\nA negative side to consider is the lack of privacy after hours and in weekends. Most nannies keep themselves busy and have a V in their living area, but they do need to share the kitchen and bathrooms with the family.\r\n\r\n<strong>Live-Out Nanny</strong>: There is a lack of space for a nanny to live with the family and the family want to keep their privacy, especially in the weekends and after hours. Most of the qualified and experienced nannies are live-out nannies, they have their own homes and families to go back to at the end of each day.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Contact Bumble Bees Nannies via Email or Phone</strong>\r\n\r\nFill in an <a title=\"Family Registration Form\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/family-registration/\">online form</a> with the basic details of your family needs and then we will contact you with further questions. Or email <a href=\"mailto:richelle@bumblebeesnannies.com\">Richelle</a> directly with a brief message on what you are looking for.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Application Forms</strong>\r\n\r\nOnce this has been done, we will call you to discuss your needs and answer any questions you may have. An application form will t hen be emailed to you that you will need to fill out and email back. We use this to write job descriptions for the nannies to read and to help us get a sense of what you are looking for to make the match.\r\n\r\nBumble Bees Nannies likes to conduct face to face meetings with families as well as nannies so they can get a better idea of the family so we can match you with a nanny, not only by interests and family requirements, but also by personalities.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Nanny Search</strong>\r\n\r\nOnce Bumble Bees Nannies has received the application form, she will start looking for nannies who suit your needs and wants. During this process, we will keep in regular contact with you, updating you on the progress.\r\n\r\n<strong>6. Interview Process</strong>\r\n\r\nOnce Bumble Bees Nannies has found nannies that we think will suit what you are looking for, you will be emailed resumes to read through as well as our own personal thoughts about why the nanny would suit your family. If you are interested in the nannies, then an interview will be setup. During this stage, a Booking Fee will be invoiced to you.\r\n\r\nOnce you have had your interviews and have decided on a  nanny, then a Nanny Trial will be arranged. This is so that the family and nanny get to know each other before a job offer is made.\r\n\r\n<strong>7. Nanny Trials</strong>\r\n\r\nRichelle recommends a trial so that the family can see the nanny interact with the children and family and for the nanny to see how the parents interact with their children. It should be a relaxing time, so the nanny can settle in and feel comfortable. It is recommended that the family pay the nanny for this time, minimum wage and last between 3-4 hours or to 4-5 days, depending on how well you feel it is going.\r\n\r\n<strong>8. Final Steps</strong>\r\n\r\nOnce you have decided on a nanny, then we can make a job offer to the nanny. If she accepts, then Bumble Bees Nannies will write a contract for you and the nanny can start.\r\n\r\nYou will receive a more descriptive \'Step-by-Step\' when we contact you so you know in detail how it works.','Families Step-By-Step','','inherit','open','open','','187-revision-2','','','2012-11-27 03:11:45','2012-11-27 03:11:45','',187,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/187-revision-2/',0,'revision','',0),(197,1,'2012-11-27 03:51:02','2012-11-27 03:51:02','<h4 id=\"live-out-nannies\">Live-Out Nannies</h4>\r\nLooking for someone to look after your child/children weekdays while you are at work?

A Bumble Bees Mother\'s Helper can work hours similar to a nanny or a part time or be temporary. A mother\'s help is someone who is newer to childcare, with more limited experience. They are not left in sole charge of children for extended periods - they are there to look after the children alongside the parents, or alone with the children for a limited time when the parents are busy. A mother\'s helper can help with household chores such as emptying the dishwasher, folding laundry and grocery shopping. The Mother\'s help duties can vary and will be agreed upon and clarified by contract, by both mother\'s help and employer.

If nannies have Early Childhood qualifications and/or at least 3 years experience, they will be asked to come into the agency to discuss their experiences, qualifications, philosophies on raising children and why they finished with their last employer. During this process we also discuss their interests, hobbies and their reason for becoming a nanny. I find this information important to make a great match with a  family.\r\n\r\nBumble Bees Nannies also checks:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>References</li>\r\n	<li>Valid First Aid and CPR certification</li>\r\n	<li>Up to date Police Check</li>\r\n	<li>Drivers License details and/or passport, birth certificate</li>\r\n	<li>Working status if they are not a Canadian citizen</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhile going through their resume/CV, we look for any loopholes/gaps that they have missed and find out why they have missed out certain areas.\r\n\r\nWith Bumble Bees Nannies doing this process, it will eliminate the amount of work you need to do and the amount of nannies calling you and coming into your home doing interviews. It can be confusing interviewing multiple candidates, so let Bumble Bees Nannies do all the work finding the right nanny for you. Bumble Bees Nannies aims for families to only interview 2-4 nannies which we think will suit all your needs and requirements.\r\n\r\nNannies who meet all Bumble Bees Nannies requirements will then be matched with appropriate families. With our extensive nanny screening process, we are confident that we can find the right nanny for your family.','Nanny Screening Process','','inherit','open','open','','164-revision-2','','','2012-11-23 03:18:01','2012-11-23 03:18:01','',164,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/164-revision-2/',0,'revision','',0),(270,1,'2012-11-27 04:16:15','2012-11-27 04:16:15','<ul>\r\n	<li>Written references from previous jobs and character references or phone numbers from at least two childcare positions</li>\r\n	<li>Photocopy of Birth Certificate, Passport and visa/work permit (if applicable)</li>\r\n	<li>Current First Aid and CPR certificate</li>\r\n	<li>Degree/Diploma or Certificate from all your courses</li>\r\n	<li>Two passport sized photos - smiling would be great</li>\r\n</ul>','Interview Information','','inherit','open','open','','210-revision-2','','','2012-11-27 04:16:15','2012-11-27 04:16:15','',210,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/210-revision-2/',0,'revision','',0),(271,1,'2012-11-27 04:01:39','2012-11-27 04:01:39','<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\">Register online for free - it just takes 2 minutes and attach your resume or email your resume directly to Richelle</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\">If you have enough experience or qualifications, Bumble Bees Nannies will email you an application form and interview times when we are available to meet you</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\">The application form needs to be filled out as descriptive as possible</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\">Once the interview has taken place, your references, passports and police/identity papers will be checked.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\">If all goes well, you will be contacted to become a Bumble Bees Nannies Childcare Professional</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\">Bumble Bees Nannies will call or email you with potential opportunities</span></li>\r\n</ul>','Caregivers Step-By-Step','','inherit','open','open','','202-revision-2','','','2012-11-27 04:01:39','2012-11-27 04:01:39','',202,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/202-revision-2/',0,'revision','',0),(272,1,'2012-11-27 04:13:38','2012-11-27 04:13:38','<h4>Nanny, Nanny/Share</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>ECE or ECA or qualified nanny qualification (you must present this at the interview)</li>\r\n	<li>At least three years full-time Professional Childcare experience if you are not ECE qualified</li>\r\n	<li>At least two references</li>\r\n	<li>CPR and First Aid certificates</li>\r\n	<li>Recent Police check</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Mother\'s Helper</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>At least one year experience working with children as a babysitter, camp counselor</li>\r\n	<li>Shows maturity and a strong interest in working with children</li>\r\n	<li>Willingness to learn and listen to the mother or father</li>\r\n	<li>Open communicator</li>\r\n	<li>At least two references associated with childcare and/or a character reference (such as Course Lecturer/Head of Education)</li>\r\n	<li>CPR and First Aid certificates</li>\r\n	<li>Recent Police check</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>After School Care</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>At least one year experience working with children as a babysitter, camp counselor or studying at university (ECE, Nursing, Psychology)</li>\r\n	<li>Shows maturity and a strong interest in working with children</li>\r\n	<li>Ability to help with homework</li>\r\n	<li>Open communicator</li>\r\n	<li>At least two references associated with childcare and/or a character reference (such as Course Lecturer/Head of Education)</li>\r\n	<li>CPR and First Aid certificates</li>\r\n	<li>Recent Police check</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Emergency Babysitter</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Studying ECE/ECA or many years childcare experience</li>\r\n	<li>CPR and First Aid certificates</li>\r\n	<li>Recent Police check</li>\r\n	<li>Over 17 years old</li>\r\n</ul>','Requirements To Be A Bumble Bees Childcare Professional','','inherit','open','open','','205-revision-3','','','2012-11-27 04:13:38','2012-11-27 04:13:38','',205,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/205-revision-3/',0,'revision','',0),(273,1,'2012-11-27 03:36:17','2012-11-27 03:36:17','<strong>1.

Shall I hire a Live-In or Live-Out Nanny?</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Live-In Nanny</strong>: The salary of a live-in nanny is lower because the food and accommodation is taken into account and there is extra room to accommodate the nanny (bedroom, living area, bathroom - which can be shared with the children). If a nanny lives with you, they need to have access to the kitchen and most areas of the house, tehy become a part of the family and a close bond with the nanny and family is usually developed quite quickly.\r\n\r\nA negative side to consider is the lack of privacy after hours and in weekends. Most nannies keep themselves busy and have a V in their living area, but they do need to share the kitchen and bathrooms with the family.\r\n\r\n<strong>Live-Out Nanny</strong>: There is a lack of space for a nanny to live with the family and the family want to keep their privacy, especially in the weekends and after hours. Most of the qualified and experienced nannies are live-out nannies, they have their own homes and families to go back to at the end of each day.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Contact Bumble Bees Nannies via Email or Phone</strong>\r\n\r\nFill in an <a title=\"Family Registration Form\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/family-registration/\">online form</a> with the basic details of your family needs and then we will contact you with further questions. Or email <a href=\"mailto:richelle@bumblebeesnannies.com\">Richelle</a> directly with a brief message on what you are looking for.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Application Forms</strong>\r\n\r\nOnce this has been done, we will call you to discuss your needs and answer any questions you may have. An application form will t hen be emailed to you that you will need to fill out and email back. We use this to write job descriptions for the nannies to read and to help us get a sense of what you are looking for to make the match.\r\n\r\nBumble Bees Nannies likes to conduct face to face meetings with families as well as nannies so they can get a better idea of the family so we can match you with a nanny, not only by interests and family requirements, but also by personalities.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Nanny Search</strong>\r\n\r\nOnce Bumble Bees Nannies has received the application form, she will start looking for nannies who suit your needs and wants. During this process, we will keep in regular contact with you, updating you on the progress.\r\n\r\n<strong>6. Interview Process</strong>\r\n\r\nOnce Bumble Bees Nannies has found nannies that we think will suit what you are looking for, you will be emailed resumes to read through as well as our own personal thoughts about why the nanny would suit your family. If you are interested in the nannies, then an interview will be setup. During this stage, a <a title=\"Fee Structure\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/families/fee-structure/\">Booking Fee</a> will be invoiced to you.\r\n\r\nOnce you have had your interviews and have decided on a  nanny, then a Nanny Trial will be arranged. This is so that the family and nanny get to know each other before a job offer is made.\r\n\r\n<strong>7. Nanny Trials</strong>\r\n\r\nRichelle recommends a trial so that the family can see the nanny interact with the children and family and for the nanny to see how the parents interact with their children. It should be a relaxing time, so the nanny can settle in and feel comfortable. It is recommended that the family pay the nanny for this time, minimum wage and last between 3-4 hours or to 4-5 days, depending on how well you feel it is going.\r\n\r\n<strong>8. Final Steps</strong>\r\n\r\nOnce you have decided on a nanny, then we can make a job offer to the nanny. If she accepts, then Bumble Bees Nannies will write a contract for you and the nanny can start.\r\n\r\nYou will receive a more descriptive \'Step-by-Step\' when we contact you so you know in detail how it works.','Families Step-By-Step','','inherit','open','open','','187-revision-3','','','2012-11-27 03:36:17','2012-11-27 03:36:17','',187,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/187-revision-3/',0,'revision','',0),(274,1,'2012-11-27 03:51:02','2012-11-27 03:51:02','<h4>Live-Out Nannies</h4>\r\nLooking for someone to look after your child/children weekdays while you are at work? A nanny may be the best option for you.\r\n\r\nA nanny can be full time, part time or temporary. Nannies are generally sole charge, meaning that they are the only caregiver present with your child/ren.\r\n\r\nFull-time Live-out nannies work around 8-10 hours a day, Monday - Friday. With a Live-Out Nanny, additional babysitting outside of the standard schedule can be provided by agreement or contract (at additional cost).\r\n\r\nBumble Bees Nannies have the qualifications you are looking for, including Early Childhood Education credits and years of childcare experience. A nanny can take care of a broad range of responsibilities, including just about everything related to your children:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Playing and Entertaining</li>\r\n	<li>Creating stimulating environments</li>\r\n	<li>Making sure that everything is age appropriate</li>\r\n	<li>Organizing play dates, sports and activities</li>\r\n	<li>Cleaning the children\'s rooms/bathrooms and toys</li>\r\n	<li>Helping with homework</li>\r\n	<li>Cooking for the children and associated kitchen cleanup</li>\r\n	<li>Organizing and taking children to their doctors/dentist/hair appointments</li>\r\n	<li>Children\'s laundry</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Mother\'s Help</h4>\r\nNeed an extra pair of hands to help you with your children during the day? A Bumble Bees Mother\'s Helper can work hours similar to a nanny or a part time or be temporary. A mother\'s help is someone who is newer to childcare, with more limited experience. They are not left in sole charge of children for extended periods - they are there to look after the children alongside the parents, or alone with the children for a limited time when the parents are busy. A mother\'s helper can help with household chores such as emptying the dishwasher, folding laundry and grocery shopping. The Mother\'s help duties can vary and will be agreed upon and clarified by contract, by both mother\'s help and employer. Mother\'s helpers generally do not provide housekeeping services.\r\n<h4>After School Care</h4>\r\nBumble Bees Nannies can provide quality After School Care. They will pick up your children from school, organize after school activities, help children with their homework, cook dinner and make sure all information from school is given to parents.\r\n\r\nWe usually try and place daycare teachers who have morning jobs or university students who are completing their degrees, ECE diplomas, Nursing students, psychology that are looking to work as After School Nannies to earn extra money.\r\n\r\nNanny Share\r\n\r\nCheck our <a title=\"Nanny Share Family Finder\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/nanny-share/\">Nanny Share</a> section for more information.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Childcare Options','','inherit','open','open','','197-revision-2','','','2012-11-27 03:51:02','2012-11-27 03:51:02','',197,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/197-revision-2/',0,'revision','',0),(275,1,'2012-12-01 21:44:33','2012-12-01 21:44:33','Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

A Bumble Bees Mother\'s Helper can work hours similar to a nanny or a part time or be temporary. A mother\'s help is someone who is newer to childcare, with more limited experience. They are not left in sole charge of children for extended periods - they are there to look after the children alongside the parents, or alone with the children for a limited time when the parents are busy. A mother\'s helper can help with household chores such as emptying the dishwasher, folding laundry and grocery shopping. The Mother\'s help duties can vary and will be agreed upon and clarified by contract, by both mother\'s help and employer.

If nannies have Early Childhood qualifications and/or at least 3 years experience, they will be asked to come into the agency to discuss their experiences, qualifications, philosophies on raising children and why they finished with their last employer. During this process we also discuss their interests, hobbies and their reason for becoming a nanny. I find this information important to make a great match with a  family.\r\n\r\nBumble Bees Nannies also checks:\r\n<ul class=\"styled\">\r\n	<li>References</li>\r\n	<li>Valid First Aid and CPR certification</li>\r\n	<li>Up to date Police Check</li>\r\n	<li>Drivers License details and/or passport, birth certificate</li>\r\n	<li>Working status if they are not a Canadian citizen</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhile going through their resume/CV, we look for any loopholes/gaps that they have missed and find out why they have missed out certain areas.\r\n\r\nWith Bumble Bees Nannies doing this process, it will eliminate the amount of work you need to do and the amount of nannies calling you and coming into your home doing interviews. It can be confusing interviewing multiple candidates, so let Bumble Bees Nannies do all the work finding the right nanny for you. Bumble Bees Nannies aims for families to only interview 2-4 nannies which we think will suit all your needs and requirements.\r\n\r\nNannies who meet all Bumble Bees Nannies requirements will then be matched with appropriate families. With our extensive nanny screening process, we are confident that we can find the right nanny for your family.','Nanny Screening Process','','inherit','open','open','','164-revision-3','','','2012-11-30 04:29:39','2012-11-30 04:29:39','',164,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/164-revision-3/',0,'revision','',0),(288,1,'2012-11-27 03:30:21','2012-11-27 03:30:21','Bumble Bees Nannies will email resumes for you to look at without charge.

A nanny may be the best option for you.\r\n\r\nA nanny can be full time, part time or temporary. Nannies are generally sole charge, meaning that they are the only caregiver present with your child/ren.\r\n\r\nFull-time Live-out nannies work around 8-10 hours a day, Monday - Friday. With a Live-Out Nanny, additional babysitting outside of the standard schedule can be provided by agreement or contract (at additional cost).\r\n\r\nBumble Bees Nannies have the qualifications you are looking for, including Early Childhood Education credits and years of childcare experience. A nanny can take care of a broad range of responsibilities, including just about everything related to your children:\r\n<ul class=\"styled\">\r\n	<li>Playing and Entertaining</li>\r\n	<li>Creating stimulating environments</li>\r\n	<li>Making sure that everything is age appropriate</li>\r\n	<li>Organizing play dates, sports and activities</li>\r\n	<li>Cleaning the children\'s rooms/bathrooms and toys</li>\r\n	<li>Helping with homework</li>\r\n	<li>Cooking for the children and associated kitchen cleanup</li>\r\n	<li>Organizing and taking children to their doctors/dentist/hair appointments</li>\r\n	<li>Children\'s laundry</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4 id=\"mothers-help\">Mother\'s Help</h4>\r\nNeed an extra pair of hands to help you with your children during the day? A Bumble Bees Mother\'s Helper can work hours similar to a nanny or a part time or be temporary. A mother\'s help is someone who is newer to childcare, with more limited experience. They are not left in sole charge of children for extended periods - they are there to look after the children alongside the parents, or alone with the children for a limited time when the parents are busy. A mother\'s helper can help with household chores such as emptying the dishwasher, folding laundry and grocery shopping. The Mother\'s help duties can vary and will be agreed upon and clarified by contract, by both mother\'s help and employer. Mother\'s helpers generally do not provide housekeeping services.\r\n<h4 id=\"after-school-care\">After School Care</h4>\r\nBumble Bees Nannies can provide quality After School Care. They will pick up your children from school, organize after school activities, help children with their homework, cook dinner and make sure all information from school is given to parents.\r\n\r\nWe usually try and place daycare teachers who have morning jobs or university students who are completing their degrees, ECE diplomas, Nursing students, psychology that are looking to work as After School Nannies to earn extra money.\r\n\r\n<h4 id=\"nanny-share\">Nanny Share</h4>\r\n\r\nCheck our <a title=\"Nanny Share Family Finder\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/nanny-share/\">Nanny Share</a> section for more information.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Childcare Options','','inherit','open','open','','197-revision-4','','','2012-12-01 22:25:10','2012-12-01 22:25:10','',197,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/197-revision-4/',0,'revision','',0),(312,1,'2012-11-28 03:12:54','2012-11-28 03:12:54','Here are the job vacancies, with the text that goes along describing the jobs...','Job Vacancies','','inherit','open','open','','21-revision-6','','','2012-11-28 03:12:54','2012-11-28 03:12:54','',21,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/21-revision-6/',0,'revision','',0),(313,1,'2012-12-02 02:34:22','2012-12-02 02:34:22','Here is the Job Vacancies description, with the text that goes along describing the jobs...\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Full Time\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/job-vacancies/full-time/\">Full Time</a>\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Part Time\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/job-vacancies/part-time/\">Part Time</a>\r\n\r\n<a title=\"After School Care\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/job-vacancies/after-school-care/\">After School Care</a>','Job Vacancies','','inherit','open','open','','21-revision-7','','','2012-12-02 02:34:22','2012-12-02 02:34:22','',21,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/21-revision-7/',0,'revision','',0),(314,1,'2012-12-02 02:35:03','2012-12-02 02:35:03','Here is the Job Vacancies description, with the text that goes along describing the jobs...\r\n\r\n<a class=\"btn\" title=\"Full Time\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/job-vacancies/full-time/\">Full Time</a>\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Part Time\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/job-vacancies/part-time/\">Part Time</a>\r\n\r\n<a title=\"After School Care\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/job-vacancies/after-school-care/\">After School Care</a>','Job Vacancies','','inherit','open','open','','21-revision-8','','','2012-12-02 02:35:03','2012-12-02 02:35:03','',21,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/21-revision-8/',0,'revision','',0),(315,1,'2012-12-02 02:35:29','2012-12-02 02:35:29','Here is the Job Vacancies description, with the text that goes along describing the jobs...\r\n\r\n<div class=\"controls\">\r\n<a class=\"btn\" title=\"Full Time\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/job-vacancies/full-time/\">Full Time</a>\r\n\r\n<a class=\"btn\" title=\"Part Time\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/job-vacancies/part-time/\">Part Time</a>\r\n\r\n<a class=\"btn\" title=\"After School Care\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/job-vacancies/after-school-care/\">After School Care</a>\r\n</div>','Job Vacancies','','inherit','open','open','','21-revision-9','','','2012-12-02 02:35:29','2012-12-02 02:35:29','',21,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/21-revision-9/',0,'revision','',0),(316,1,'2012-12-02 02:39:10','2012-12-02 02:39:10','Here is where you contact Bumble Bees Nannies to get in touch regarding a particular job.','Contact Family','','publish','open','open','','contact-job','','','2012-12-03 22:17:04','2012-12-03 22:17:04','',21,'http://localhost/bumblebees/?page_id=316',0,'page','',0),(317,1,'2012-12-02 02:39:03','2012-12-02 02:39:03','','Contact Family','','inherit','open','open','','316-revision','','','2012-12-02 02:39:03','2012-12-02 02:39:03','',316,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/316-revision/',0,'revision','',0),(318,1,'2012-11-11 18:47:52','2012-11-11 18:47:52','Here\'s some introduction to the caregivers registration form page.

There is usually only 1 child from each family in this option.\r\n<strong>Option 2:</strong> The nanny alternates between caring for one family’s children on one day, and the other family’s children on the other days.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"divider div3\"></div>\r\n\r\nWith a nanny share, the families involved should have the same philosophies on parenting, routines, discipline, etc. In most nanny shares, the involved families have one child each. Nanny share nannies usually work between 45- 50 hours per week.\r\n\r\nMany families would like to alternate between the two houses, 1-2 weeks in each home. If this is done it could unsettle the children and disrupt their routine. Consistency is very important for young children. It can also disrupt the nannies routine and schedule especially when children’s items are forgotten eg winter hats and gloves, sunscreen, bottles.\r\n\r\n<h4>Points to consider when starting a Nanny Share</h4>\r\n<ul class=\"styled\">\r\n	<li>The household where the children will be based will need to have an extra sleeping area and bed (pack and play)</li>\r\n	<li>The cost of children’s groceries will need to be halved ie. milk, food, diapers, wipes</li>\r\n	<li>Transport for two children, whether it be two car seats or a double stroller if needed.</li>\r\n	<li>Transporting your child’s bottles every morning and afternoon or buying an extra set for the other house</li>\r\n	<li>For the house that is having the children that there will be more toys, bottles, plates, cups in your home.</li>\r\n	<li>When the nanny gets vacations which would work for both families. Most nannies get between 2 weeks’ vacation and the days between Christmas and New Year. For the two weeks I always recommend that the families pick one week and the nanny picks the other week to make it fair.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Positives of being a part of a Nanny share</h4>\r\n<ul class=\"styled\">\r\n	<li>Sharing the cost of the nanny ages/ salary</li>\r\n	<li>The children learn to socialize with children their own age</li>\r\n	<li>Develop a close friendship with the other child</li>\r\n	<li>The children learn to share and participate with each other.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"controls\">\r\n<button class=\"btn\" onclick=\"document.location=\'families-sharing\';\">Families With A Shared Nanny</button><button class=\"btn\" onclick=\"document.location=\'families-looking\';\">Families Looking For A Shared Nanny</button>\r\n</div>','Nanny Share Family Finder','','inherit','open','open','','115-revision-18','','','2012-12-02 00:47:41','2012-12-02 00:47:41','',115,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/115-revision-18/',0,'revision','',0),(332,1,'2012-12-03 01:56:22','2012-12-03 01:56:22','<h4>RichelleAssenberg - Owner</h4>\r\nBumble Bees Nannies is owned and operated by RichelleAssenberg, a qualified Early Childhood Teacher and childcare professional with 12 years Early Childhood experience. Richelle started her career as a kindergarten and daycare teacher in New Zealand, before relocating to the United Kingdom to continue her work caring and nurturing children and families as a professional nanny. After settling in Toronto and consulting with several nanny agencies, Richelle knew she could offer families a more professional, customized and personal service.\r\n\r\n“Hi, my name is Richelle and I am here to help nannies and families find each other. I hope to help families find their perfect nanny efficiently and easily, while helping nannies find a family that they love working for.

She was in contact with me throughout the experience and she matched me with a family that matched me perfectly. I have never been happier with my work. Richelle really worked with me to find me the hours, the family, the kids and even the area that suited my wants as well as my needs. She was quick to reply to emails or phone calls which I really appreciated as I needed a job in a very short period of time and she was able to find me an appropriate family in about a month. I love working for my family and they have really welcomed me into their home. I think it\'s Richelle\'s personal touch in each placement that makes the placements work so amazingly. She really got to know me so that she could see which families I would fit with and where my skills would be best used.

Richelle was immediately helpful and warm and took note of our special needs. All her applicants were wonderful, a step up from the other nannies we had interviewed. Ultimately, we have been extremely happy with our lovely nanny and our son definitely gives her a high five”\r\n- <strong>J.O- Mother from Leslieville</strong>\r\n\r\n“Bumble Bees Nannies were very knowledgeable and helpful when it came to finding someone for our nanny share position. Being a first-time parent, I was intimidated by the prospect of having to find a nanny to care for my son and my friend\'s daughter. Not only did they answer our many questions, but they were also able to find us a nanny that is a truly wonderful fit with both families. Our children enjoy spending time with her and we have peace of mind knowing that they are getting quality care every day. Thank you Bumble Bees Nannies!”\r\n- <strong>J.H Mother from East Toronto</strong>\r\n\r\n“Bumble Bees Nannies took the daunting task of finding the right childcare and made it simple! Richelle was such a tremendous help to my friend and I who were searching for a nanny to do a share with. We simply communicated what we were looking for and Richelle presented us with 3 women to interview and all were wonderful. We now have a fantastic nanny who is loving and interactive with our children and the kids adore her! A great service for busy parents who want the best for their family”\r\n- <strong>S.P Toronto</strong>\r\n\r\n“Great Nanny Agency! The service that we received from Richelle at Bumble Bees Nannies was unlike any other nanny agency that we have dealt with in Toronto. Previous agencies had just sent us nanny after nanny which we had to interview to find out that they were not fit with our family. Bumble Bees Nannies listened to our needs as a family and worked to find us the right nanny from the start. Richelle only had to send us 2 nannies to interview before we found the perfect match and that is all down to her hard work in the background. This saved us time and money. We have recommended using Bumble Bees Nannies to all of our friends”\r\n- <strong>Father from East Toronto</strong>','Testimonials From Parents','','inherit','open','open','','339-revision-5','','','2012-12-03 02:12:15','2012-12-03 02:12:15','',339,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/339-revision-5/',0,'revision','',0),(355,1,'2012-12-03 02:18:17','2012-12-03 02:18:17','','Nanny','','publish','open','open','','nanny-2','','','2012-12-03 02:19:09','2012-12-03 02:19:09','',154,'http://localhost/bumblebees/?p=355',1,'nav_menu_item','',0),(356,1,'2012-12-03 02:19:09','2012-12-03 02:19:09','','Emergency Babysitting','','publish','open','open','','emergency-babysitting-2','','','2012-12-03 02:19:09','2012-12-03 02:19:09','',154,'http://localhost/bumblebees/?p=356',4,'nav_menu_item','',0),(357,1,'2012-11-20 03:19:20','2012-11-20 03:19:20','Below are the Families Bumble Bees Nannies have registered who have a Nanny and are looking to share with another family:','Families Sharing','','inherit','open','open','','130-revision-3','','','2012-11-20 03:19:20','2012-11-20 03:19:20','',130,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/130-revision-3/',0,'revision','',0),(358,1,'2012-11-20 03:23:34','2012-11-20 03:23:34','These families are looking for a Family who would like to share their nanny:','Looking For A Family','','inherit','open','open','','133-revision-4','','','2012-11-20 03:23:34','2012-11-20 03:23:34','',133,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/133-revision-4/',0,'revision','',0),(359,1,'2012-12-03 02:24:04','2012-12-03 02:24:04','To get your details on the Nanny Share Family Finder, you need to contact Bumble Bees Nannies and fill out an application form.

There is usually only 1 child from each family in this option.\r\n<strong>Option 2:</strong> The nanny alternates between caring for one family’s children on one day, and the other family’s children on the other days.\r\n<div class=\"divider div3\"></div>\r\nWith a nanny share, the families involved should have the same philosophies on parenting, routines, discipline, etc. In most nanny shares, the involved families have one child each. Nanny share nannies usually work between 45- 50 hours per week.\r\n\r\nMany families would like to alternate between the two houses, 1-2 weeks in each home. This can unsettle the children and disrupt their routine. Consistency is very important for young children. It can also disrupt the nannies schedule especially when children’s items are left at the other home eg favourite toy, winter hats and gloves, sunscreen, bottles.\r\n<h4>Points to consider when starting a Nanny Share</h4>\r\n<ul class=\"styled\">\r\n	<li>The household where the children will be based will need to have an extra sleeping area and bed (pack and play)</li>\r\n	<li>The cost of children’s groceries will need to be halved ie. milk, food, diapers, wipes</li>\r\n	<li>Transport for two children, whether it be two car seats or a double stroller if needed.</li>\r\n	<li>Transporting your child’s bottles every morning and afternoon or buying an extra set for the other house</li>\r\n	<li>For the house that is having the children that there will be more toys, bottles, plates, cups in your home.</li>\r\n	<li>When the nanny gets vacations which would work for both families. Most nannies get between 2 weeks’ vacation and the days between Christmas and New Year. For the two weeks I always recommend that the families pick one week and the nanny picks the other week to make it fair.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Positives of being a part of a Nanny share</h4>\r\n<ul class=\"styled\">\r\n	<li>Sharing the cost of the nanny ages/ salary</li>\r\n	<li>The children learn to socialize with children their own age</li>\r\n	<li>Develop a close friendship with the other child</li>\r\n	<li>The children learn to share and participate with each other.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"controls\"><button class=\"btn\" onclick=\"document.location=\'families-sharing\';\">Families With A Shared Nanny</button><button class=\"btn\" onclick=\"document.location=\'families-looking\';\">Families Looking For A Shared Nanny</button></div>','Nanny Share Family Finder','','inherit','open','open','','115-revision-19','','','2012-12-03 01:53:23','2012-12-03 01:53:23','',115,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/115-revision-19/',0,'revision','',0),(365,1,'2012-12-03 02:33:07','2012-12-03 02:33:07','','Blog','','publish','open','open','','blog','','','2012-12-03 02:51:50','2012-12-03 02:51:50','',0,'http://localhost/bumblebees/?page_id=365',0,'page','',0),(366,1,'2012-12-03 02:32:54','2012-12-03 02:32:54','','Blog','','inherit','open','open','','365-revision','','','2012-12-03 02:32:54','2012-12-03 02:32:54','',365,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/365-revision/',0,'revision','',0),(367,1,'2012-12-03 02:38:46','0000-00-00 00:00:00','','Auto Draft','','auto-draft','open','open','','','','','2012-12-03 02:38:46','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://localhost/bumblebees/?page_id=367',0,'page','',0),(368,1,'2012-12-03 02:39:16','0000-00-00 00:00:00','','Auto Draft','','auto-draft','open','open','','','','','2012-12-03 02:39:16','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://localhost/bumblebees/?page_id=368',0,'page','',0),(369,1,'2012-12-03 02:33:07','2012-12-03 02:33:07','','Blog','','inherit','open','open','','365-revision-2','','','2012-12-03 02:33:07','2012-12-03 02:33:07','',365,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/365-revision-2/',0,'revision','',0),(370,1,'2012-12-03 02:48:16','2012-12-03 02:48:16',' ','','','publish','open','open','','370','','','2012-12-03 02:48:16','2012-12-03 02:48:16','',0,'http://localhost/bumblebees/?p=370',3,'nav_menu_item','',0),(371,1,'2012-12-03 02:39:32','2012-12-03 02:39:32','','Blog','','inherit','open','open','','365-revision-3','','','2012-12-03 02:39:32','2012-12-03 02:39:32','',365,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/365-revision-3/',0,'revision','',0),(372,1,'2012-12-03 02:48:38','2012-12-03 02:48:38','','Blog','','inherit','open','open','','365-revision-4','','','2012-12-03 02:48:38','2012-12-03 02:48:38','',365,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/365-revision-4/',0,'revision','',0),(373,1,'2012-12-03 03:25:57','2012-12-03 03:25:57','Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
