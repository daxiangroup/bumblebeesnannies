Though there are hundreds of people around the globe organizing WordCamps, WordPress meetups, hackathons, free classes and the like, since their &#8220;projects&#8221; were all happening locally there was never a central hub of activity for these folks. Despite the many informal connections between community organizers, we weren&#8217;t taking advantage of the huge existing knowledge base as new organizers stepped up to the plate.</p>\n<p>With the creation of <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/events/\">this new contributor group</a>, we finally have a way to organize and recognize these kinds of contributions, a clear avenue for feedback and input when it comes to policies around official events, and the opportunity to create even more connections between community organizers through mentorship programs and group projects. I&#8217;m especially excited about the creation of this group because until now the role of community organizer, while one of the most important, has not gotten the same recognition as higher-profile contribution methods such as forum support or core code contribution. That is something I hope this group will change, and the local organizers can be recognized for the community leaders they are.*</p>\n<p>If you are the organizer of a local WordCamp, WordPress meetup, etc., head over to <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/events/\">http://make.wordpress.org/events/</a> and introduce yourself so we can include you in the fun!</p>\n<p>Speaking of meetups, an update on <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/01/year-of-the-meetup/\">my last post about meetups</a> is long overdue. With around 500 meetup organizers (and/or potential organizers) responding to my last survey, it took much longer than anticipated to review all the responses. We&#8217;re working now with meetup.com to issue invitations to join a centralized WordPress Meetup account, so if you filled out the form earlier this year, you should be hearing from them soon. The first wave of existing meetup account transfers (for those who opted in) should happen in the next two weeks, with additional waves every 3 months thereafter (and new groups will be able to be created along the way).</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/05/calling-all-contributors-community-summit-2012/\">contributor summit</a> that is being planned for the end of October also generated hundreds of responses/nominations, so that review process is still happening, but we should be announcing some basic plans and issuing invitations soon.</p>\n<p>And finally, it would be impossible to talk about in-person WordPress events without mentioning the upcoming annual <a href=\"http://2012.sf.wordcamp.org\">WordCamp in San Francisco</a>. As the event that represents the worldwide project as a whole, it&#8217;s the perfect time to evaluate where we stand as a project and as a community, to help determine where we go next. If you&#8217;re a WordPress user, developer, or in any way a part of our vast and interconnected ecosystem, please take a moment to fill in the <a href=\"http://wpsurvey.polldaddy.com/s/wp-2012\">2nd annual WordPress survey</a>. It&#8217;s just a couple of questions, and your input would be greatly appreciated. The results of the survey will be announced at <a href=\"http://2012.sf.wordcamp.org\">WSCF</a>, and a report issued shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>*<em> I am also of the firm belief that academic and arts activities should earn varsity letters just like sports teams do &#8212; go mathletes! </em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/07/event-organizers-unite/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"WordPress 3.4.1 Maintenance and Security Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/wordpress-3-4-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/wordpress-3-4-1/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:57:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2383\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:379:\"WordPress 3.4.1 is now available for download.

These issues were discovered and fixed by the WordPress security team.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/download/\">Download 3.4.1</a> now or visit Dashboard → Updates in your site admin to update now.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Green was a bit green<br />\nWe have hardened it up some<br />\nUpdate WordPress now</em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/wordpress-3-4-1/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"WordPress 3.4 “Green”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/green/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/green/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 13 Jun 2012 18:42:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2334\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:386:\"WordPress 3.4 is here and out the door.

We&#8217;ve dubbed this release &#8220;Green&#8221; in honor of guitarist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Green\">Grant Green</a> whose soulful simplicity has kept many of us company during this release.</p>\n<p>This release includes significant improvements to theme customization, custom headers, Twitter embeds, and image captions &#8212; here&#8217;s a short clip with the highlights:</p>\n<div id=\"v-Gg0EFixV-1\" class=\"video-player\"><embed id=\"v-Gg0EFixV-1-video\" src=\"http://s0.videopress.com/player.swf?v=1.03&amp;guid=Gg0EFixV&amp;isDynamicSeeking=true\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"692\" height=\"388\" title=\"Introducing WordPress 3.4 &quot;Green&quot;\" wmode=\"direct\" seamlesstabbing=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" overstretch=\"true\"></embed></div>\n<h3>For Users</h3>\n<p>The biggest change in 3.4 is the <strong>theme customizer</strong> which allows you to play around with various looks and settings for your current theme or one you&#8217;re thinking about switching to without publishing those changes to the whole world. For themes that support it, you can change colors, backgrounds, and of course custom image headers. We have more planned for the customizer down the road.</p>\n<p>Throughout the rest of the admin you&#8217;ll notice tweaks to make your everyday life easier. For example, if you have lots of themes we&#8217;ve made it quicker to browse them all at once without paging. We&#8217;ve made it possible to use images from your media library to populate custom headers, and for you to choose the height and width of your header images.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve expanded our embed support to include tweets: just put a Twitter permalink on its own line in the post editor and we&#8217;ll turn it into a beautiful embedded Tweet. And finally, image captions have been improved to allow HTML, like links, in them.</p>\n<h3>For Developers</h3>\n<p>There are hundreds of under-the-hood improvements in this release, notably in the XML-RPC, themes, and custom header APIs, and significant performance improvements in WP_Query and the translation system. <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.4\">The Codex has a pretty good summary of the developer features</a>, and you can always <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/3.4\">dive into Trac directly</a>.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also <a href=\"http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/wordpress-3-4-field-guide-for-developers/\">put together a busy developer&#8217;s field guide to the new APIs in 3.4</a>.</p>\n<h3>It takes a village</h3>\n<p>Here are some of the fine folks who were involved in bringing 3.4 to the world:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/082net\">082net</a>, <a href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/aaroncampbell\">Aaron D.

Out of the choices listed, I voted for Responsive Design because of the prolific usage of Tablets and smartphones versus the traditional desktop computer. On that note, I think it was a very wise choice to have the new default theme in WordPress 3.5 have a responsive design by default. After you place your vote, feel free to come on back in the comments section and explain why you voted for that choice. </p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss\">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/vote-for-the-new-header-design\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Vote For The New Header Design\">Vote For The New Header Design</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-to-be-in-charge-of-the-2012-default-theme\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Matt Mullenweg To Be In Charge Of The 2012 Default Theme\">Matt Mullenweg To Be In Charge Of The 2012 Default Theme</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/theme-fm-theme-store-reopens\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Theme.FM Theme Store Reopens\">Theme.FM Theme Store Reopens</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/BzOCfoNIMHc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 04 Dec 2012 17:43:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"WordPress.tv: Ed Nailor: Truly Dynamic Sidebars\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wordpress.tv/?p=14358\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"http://wordpress.tv/2012/12/04/ed-nailor-truly-dynamic-sidebars/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:855:\"<div id=\"v-ldYw31W5-1\" class=\"video-player\">\n</div>\n<p>Slides are available at: <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/ednailor/truly-dynamic-sidebars-for-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.slideshare.net/ednailor/truly-dynamic-sidebars-for-wordpress</a></p>\n<br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/14358/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/14358/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=14358&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><div><a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2012/12/04/ed-nailor-truly-dynamic-sidebars/\"><img alt=\"Ed Nailor- Truly Dynamic Sidebars.m4v\" src=\"http://videos.videopress.com/ldYw31W5/video-972cb6706f_std.original.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"120\" /></a></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 04 Dec 2012 15:11:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"WordPress.tv\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress 3.5 RC 3 Released\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=12300\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~3/F1VryC7Gss4/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1263:\"<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a> 3.5 RC 3 <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/12/wordpress-3-5-release-candidate-3/\">has been released</a>.</p>\n<p>This RC is quite polished, and it looks like the final WordPress 3.5 release may be just a few days away judging by their previous timeline.

Since version 2.0. It’s been a long run. It began as a need to fill people in about new features in WordPress (and there were a lot in 2.0). There wasn’t anybody doing these at the time, and certainly WordPress wasn’t nearly as popular as it is now (22% of the internet is powered by WordPress).</p>\n<p>But many more people have stepped up in recent releases and have started updating readers with new features and expectations. My job here is done. I’m passing the baton but really the baton has already been passed and I’m happy about that. This will be my final 10 things article. Thank you for sticking around and following along all these years.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I want to personally thank Aaron for putting together those 10 things posts as they were always a highlight to read as well as signaling that the next major release of WordPress was very imminent. </p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss\">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/things-you-should-know-about-wordpress-3-3\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Things You Should Know About WordPress 3.3\">Things You Should Know About WordPress 3.3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/have-you-pre-ordered-your-wordpress-bible\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Have You Pre-ordered Your WordPress Bible?\">Have You Pre-ordered Your WordPress Bible?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-27-a-milestone-in-its-own-right\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"WordPress 2.7 A Milestone In Its Own Right\">WordPress 2.7 A Milestone In Its Own Right</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/TbEGz8ledPs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 03 Dec 2012 16:25:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"WPTavern: WordPress For iOS 3.3 Released\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=6683\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/TsVUg2Kooqk/wordpress-for-ios-3-3-released\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1729:\"<p><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/WordPressForIOS3.3.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/WordPressForIOS3.3.jpg\" alt=\"WordPress For iOS 3.3 Logo\" title=\"WordPressForIOS3.3\" width=\"137\" height=\"52\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-6684\" /></a>The WordPress iOS team has <a href=\"http://ios.wordpress.org/2012/12/03/version-3-3/\">released version 3.3</a> of the popular mobile app. Thanks to 3.3, the app now has sounds such as clicks, refreshes and a crumple sound when you discard panels on the iPad. Since I use my iPhone on vibrate all the time, the sounds are a minor addition. However, they are a nice touch for the app overall. Outside of the addition of sounds, the release boasts more than 20 bug fixes and stability improvements. The next version looks like it will include a new Notification feature for WordPress.com and Jetpack enabled blogs. A new Visual editor is also in the works. </p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss\">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-iphone-app-2-7-released\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"WordPress iPhone App 2.7 Released\">WordPress iPhone App 2.7 Released</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/beta-team-being-established-for-wordpress-ios\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Beta Team Being Established For WordPress iOS\">Beta Team Being Established For WordPress iOS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/managewp-to-soon-be-available-as-an-ios-app\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"ManageWP To Soon Be Available As An iOS App\">ManageWP To Soon Be Available As An iOS App</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/TsVUg2Kooqk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 03 Dec 2012 16:03:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"WPTavern: WebDevStudios Acquires Startbox Theme Framework\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=6678\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:109:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/lOPXUliyAj8/webdevstudios-acquires-startbox-theme-framework\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4511:\"<p><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/startboxlogo.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/startboxlogo.jpg\" alt=\"Startbox Theme Framework Logo\" title=\"startboxlogo\" width=\"272\" height=\"57\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-6679\" /></a>A few days ago, <a href=\"http://webdevstudios.com/2012/11/28/startbox-finds-a-new-home-with-webdevstudios/\">WebDevStudios announced</a> that they acquired the <a href=\"http://wpstartbox.com\">Startbox</a> theme framework.

There are a ton of great themes and frameworks out there, so it really comes down to what is the best fit for the person or project. StartBox is our first major push into the commercial WordPress space. Our goal is to focus on making the StartBox theme framework as amazing as possible. Everything else is just gravy.</p>\n<p><strong>Will you be sticking with the Theme Club idea already established by StartBox?</strong></p>\n<p>For now yes, but that could change in the future. Currently you can access all child themes for $100/year or purchase any single child theme for $47.  We currently have 9 child themes available, but plan on rapidly expanding that in 2013. The StartBox core framework is also 100% freely available via Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/StartBox\">https://github.com/WebDevStudios/StartBox</a></p>\n<p>At WebDevStudios, we pride ourselves on having a strong focus on development. Because of that we plan on making some really amazing child themes and utilize those strong development skills to include features that go above and beyond what users might see in other themes out there. These themes and features will also carry over into our client work so it&#8217;s really a win win for us.</p>\n<p><strong>Will all previous plugins created by WebDevStudios be moved under the StartBox club umbrella? </strong></p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t have any plans to move our existing plugins to the theme club. We are working on a few pro versions of our plugins, but the base plugins will always remain free and available on WordPress.org. We do have plans to build plugins specifically for StartBox. If a StartBox plugin would be useful in other themes, and not just a feature specific to StartBox, we plan on coding and releasing it for everyone to use.</p>\n<p><strong>When I think of WebDevStudios, the thing that pops into my mind first is the Genesis Theme Framework. Will Genesis no longer be the framework of choice for future client work?</strong></p>\n<p>We love Genesis and that doesn&#8217;t change because of StartBox. Going forward we do plan on using StartBox for most client work, but ultimately will use whatever theme is a good fit for the project. A good amount of our contacts come to us wanting Genesis, so we will certainly give them what they want.</p>\n<p>The beauty of StartBox is it allows us to not only shape the future of the theme framework, but also build and sell really amazing child themes for StartBox. We&#8217;ve given a lot of consideration to building and selling stand-alone themes and custom child themes for other frameworks, but at the end of the day we decided to focus on a framework that we have full control over.  </p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss\">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/which-theme-framework-to-use\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Which Theme

src=\"http://wpiphone.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/wpios-3-3-sounds.jpg?w=240&h=517\" height=\"517\" width=\"240\" /></a>Since the release of version 3.2 the team has been hard at work on several new features. Today we&#8217;re we&#8217;re happy to announce that the first &#8212; in-app Sounds &#8212; is <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880?mt=8\">now available in version 3.3</a>. Adding sounds to the app has been on our wish list a long time, and while this is a modest update, we hope you will enjoy it!</p>\n<h3>Sounds</h3>\n<p>There are five new sounds created by the talented <a href=\"http://www.joshmobley.com/\">Josh Mobley</a> in the app:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You&#8217;ll hear a swish sound when you open a panel on the iPhone, or tap a menu item on the iPad.</li>\n<li>A pulling sound plays when you pull down to refresh content.</li>\n<li>Once the refresh completes you&#8217;ll hear a click.</li>\n<li>When you receive a new comment a chime will let you know about it immediately.</li>\n<li>The app now makes a crumple sound when you discard panels on the iPad.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our goal is to provide elegant sounds that enhance your experience with WordPress for iOS, but you can mute the new sounds from the Settings screen if you prefer a silent app. Your device&#8217;s mute button will silence the app as well.</p>\n<h3>Stability Improvements</h3>\n<p>In addition to the new sounds effects, we continue to make the app even more stable. In this release we fixed a total of <a href=\"http://ios.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/3.3\">21 issues</a>.</p>\n<h3>Next Up</h3>\n<p>A new Notifications feature for WordPress.com and <a href=\"http://jetpack.me\">Jetpack-enabled</a> blogs is nearing completion. We also have a visual editor in the works, which we&#8217;re very excited about. If these are features you&#8217;re interested in helping with, or if you have a different feature or improvement in mind, the time to help make WordPress for iOS amazing is NOW! Drop us a note on our <a href=\"http://dev.ios.wordpress.org/\">dev blog</a> or chime in at <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/mobile\">make/mobile on WordPress.org</a> and we&#8217;ll help you get started as a contributor!</p>\n<p>A huge thanks to the contributors that worked on this release: <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/profile/koke\">koke</a>, <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/profile/aerych\">aerych</a>, <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/profile/mrroundhill\">mrroundhill</a>, fklu, <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/profile/jkudish\">jkudish</a>, <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/profile/daniloercoli\">daniloercoli</a>, <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/profile/isaackeyet\">isaackeyet</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.joshmobley.com/\">jmobb</a>.</p>\n<p>What do you think of the new sound effects?

Schneider, CEO of Automattic was <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/28/wordpress-com-restaurant-toni-schneider-interview/\">recently interviewed</a> on TechCrunch TV. In the interview, they discussed the new vertical launched on WordPress.com for restaurants. There were a couple of things within this interview that I found fascinating. </p>\n<p>The first is that across the Automattic network which includes sites such as PollDaddy, Gravatar, VaultPress and WordPress.com, Quantcast reports 660,000,000 monthly unique visitors making it the largest network on Quantcast. </p>\n<p>The second is that, WordPress.com operates on the principle of small, incremental changes to the service. Because of this, WordPress.com has gone through about 50,000 versions of WordPress, if every change was a bump in the version number. Even at their current size and scale, they still release multiple batches of code every day. </p>\n<p>Thirdly, I thought it was interesting that Toni Schneider basically said that WordPress.com is following the lead of the overall WordPress community when it comes to features and or verticals on WordPress.com. </p>\n<p>Last but not least, WordPress powers 17.2% of the web, Joomla powers 3% and Drupal has 2%. Everyone else encompasses the rest of the 100%. So while it seems like everyone and their mother as well as their grandpa has a site on WordPress, there is still a huge segment of the market that&#8217;s been untapped by WordPress. </p>\n<p>After watching the interview, is there anything that surprises you or is this all par for the course?</p>\n<div class=\"aligncenter\">\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss\">\n<p>Related

just two weeks, so I imagine it&#8217;s just about a week away now. Please do try it on a test installation, especially if you are a plugin or theme developer who would rather not have a panic of bug reports on launch day if your product has any incompatibilities with WordPress 3.5. The Media tools have received a rather extensive overhaul, so you might want to try those out if you frequently rely on them, and if you&#8217;re a <a href=\"http://wordpress.com\">WordPress.com</a> blogger, <a href=\"http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2012/11/29/seamless-media/\">the new Media tools are now live on your WordPress.com blog</a>.</p>\n<p>If you run into any bugs, please check the <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/6\">known</a> and <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&group=component&milestone=3.5\">fixed</a> issues first, <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Reporting_Bugs\">report them</a> if they have not already been reported, and visit <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta\">the support forums</a> if you need any help.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~4/_bM2zqTRp6g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 29 Nov 2012 21:34:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"James\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 3.5 Release Candidate 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2494\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/11/wordpress-3-5-release-candidate-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1508:\"<p>The second release candidate for WordPress 3.5 is now available for download and testing.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re still working on about a dozen remaining issues, but we hope to deliver WordPress 3.5 to your hands as early as next week. If you&#8217;d like to know what to test, visit the About page (<strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://wordpress.org/wp-content/themes/twentyten/images/wordpress.png\" /> → About</strong> in the toolbar) and check out the list of features! As usual, this is still development software and we suggest you do not install this on a live site unless you are adventurous.</p>\n<p><strong>Think you&#8217;ve found a bug?</strong> Please post to the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">Alpha/Beta area in the support forums</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Developers,</strong> please continue to test your plugins and themes, so that if there is a compatibility issue, we can figure it out before the final release. You can find our <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/6\">list of known issues here</a>.</p>\n<p>To test WordPress 3.5, try the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you&#8217;ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;).

However, end users are able to pick up a few things as well, especially the part about settings changes. According to the site, the admin page dedicated to Privacy settings has disappeared. The options on that page have been moved to the Reading Settings area. Also for new installs, the ability to change the Character set has been hidden and will use UTF-8 by default. I think this makes total sense and would like to see similar option UI be removed in the future. Even though the UI will be hidden, you can still access the option via options.php. Going this route seems similar to how FireFox works. While there are things to configure, those who want access to everything can go into <strong>About:config</strong>. </p>\n<p>Over the years, the saying has been, &#8220;<strong>Decisions, not options</strong>&#8220;.

Besides the tips offered for distribution, the tutorial also covers a number of things all theme authors should consider doing before releasing there theme into the wild such as making sure it&#8217;s adaptable, adding a right to left style sheet and avoiding hard coding. I was happy to see that with regards to licensing, there wasn&#8217;t much fluff added. One other thing I noticed that theme authors should find helpful is a <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Review#Bundled_Resources\">codex article</a> that lists resources that are GPL-compatible such as Fonts and icon sets. </p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss\">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/sitepoint-gives-primer-on-parent-child-themes\"

Collectively this bacteria weighs about three pounds, about the same as your brain. The evolution of our understanding of these bacteria has been evolving rapidly over the past twenty years, and I expect its findings to be the most impactful on our health and wellness in the coming decades.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/10/22/121022fa_fact_specter\">The New Yorker has a fantastic article by Michael Specter</a> that starts and ends with our changing perception of <i>heliobacter pylori</i>, linked to gastritis and peptic ulcers, but whose absence in children (it used to be universal, now fewer than 5% of children in the US carry it in their guts) is linked to asthma. It also has consequences for weight:</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<blockquote>There is equally convincing evidence that destroying <i>H. pylori</i> could alter metabolism in ways that increase the risk of obesity. Several research groups, including Blaser’s, have found a strong relationship in humans between the bacterium and two stomach hormones, ghrelin and leptin, both of which play central roles in regulating our appetites [...] The more ghrelin you have in your bloodstream, the more likely you are to overeat. Leptin functions in the opposite way, suppressing appetite and increasing energy levels. For people whose stomachs are infected by <i>H. pylori</i>, ghrelin became far less detectable after a meal. For the others, levels of the hormone remained high, and the effects are evident. [...]</p>\n<p>That finding was not a complete surprise. Roughly three-quarters of the antibiotics consumed in the United States are fed to poultry, cows, and pigs, not to treat illness but as dietary supplements to promote faster growth. [...] Until recently, the biochemical reasons for that weight gain, and its unsettling implications or humans, were murky. [...] &#8220;A lot of things are happening at once,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The rise in obesity, celiac disease, asthma, allergy syndromes, and Type 1 diabetes. Bad eating habits are not sufficient to explain the world-wide explosion in obesity.</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>The environment inside our body is as complex and varied as the one outside our body and responds just as unpredictably to wholesale changes to its ecosystem.

20:33:59','2012-11-19 20:33:59','Sometimes sharing a nanny might be the best option for your family – a more affordable alternative!\r\n\r\nWhen two families come together to share a nanny for their children, this is called a “Nanny Share”.\r\n\r\n<strong>Option 1:</strong> The nanny can care for both sets of children on all days Monday- Friday. There is usually only 1 child from each family in this option.\r\n<strong>Option 2:</strong> The nanny alternates between caring for one family’s children on one day, and the other family’s children on the other days.\r\n<div class=\"divider div3\"></div>\r\nWith a nanny share, the families involved should have the same philosophies on parenting, routines, discipline, etc. In most nanny shares, the involved families have one child each. Nanny share nannies usually work between 45- 50 hours per week.\r\n\r\nMany families would like to alternate between the two houses, 1-2 weeks in each home. This can unsettle the children and disrupt their routine. Consistency is very important for young children. It can also disrupt the nannies schedule especially when children’s items are left at the other home eg favourite toy, winter hats and gloves, sunscreen, bottles.\r\n<h4>Points to consider when starting a Nanny Share</h4>\r\n<ul class=\"styled\">\r\n	<li>The household where the children will be based will need to have an extra sleeping area and bed (pack and play)</li>\r\n	<li>The cost of children’s groceries will need to be halved ie. milk, food, diapers, wipes</li>\r\n	<li>Transport for two children, whether it be two car seats or a double stroller if needed.</li>\r\n	<li>Transporting your child’s bottles every morning and afternoon or buying an extra set for the other house</li>\r\n	<li>For the house that is having the children that there will be more toys, bottles, plates, cups in your home.</li>\r\n	<li>When the nanny gets vacations which would work for both families. Most nannies get between 2 weeks’ vacation and the days between Christmas and New Year. For the two weeks I always recommend that the families pick one week and the nanny picks the other week to make it fair.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Positives of being a part of a Nanny share</h4>\r\n<ul class=\"styled\">\r\n	<li>Sharing the cost of the nanny ages/ salary</li>\r\n	<li>The children learn to socialize with children their own age</li>\r\n	<li>Develop a close friendship with the other child</li>\r\n	<li>The children learn to share and participate with each other.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"controls\"><button class=\"btn\" onclick=\"document.location=\'families-sharing\';\">Looking For A Family</button><button class=\"btn\" onclick=\"document.location=\'families-looking\';\">Families With A Nanny To Share</button></div>','Nanny Share Family Finder','','publish','open','open','','nanny-share','','','2012-12-03 02:26:15','2012-12-03 02:26:15','',0,'http://localhost/bumblebees/?page_id=115',0,'page','',0),(116,1,'2012-11-19 20:33:41','2012-11-19 20:33:41','Welcome to the new Nanny Share Family Finder.

There is usually only 1 child from each family in this option.\n<strong>Option 2:</strong> The nanny alternates between caring for one family’s children on one day, and the other family’s children on the other days.\n<div class=\"divider div3\"></div>\nWith a nanny share, the families involved should have the same philosophies on parenting, routines, discipline, etc. In most nanny shares, the involved families have one child each. Nanny share nannies usually work between 45- 50 hours per week.\n\nMany families would like to alternate between the two houses, 1-2 weeks in each home. This can unsettle the children and disrupt their routine. Consistency is very important for young children. It can also disrupt the nannies schedule especially when children’s items are left at the other home eg favourite toy, winter hats and gloves, sunscreen, bottles.\n<h4>Points to consider when starting a Nanny Share</h4>\n<ul class=\"styled\">\n	<li>The household where the children will be based will need to have an extra sleeping area and bed (pack and play)</li>\n	<li>The cost of children’s groceries will need to be halved ie. milk, food, diapers, wipes</li>\n	<li>Transport for two children, whether it be two car seats or a double stroller if needed.</li>\n	<li>Transporting your child’s bottles every morning and afternoon or buying an extra set for the other house</li>\n	<li>For the house that is having the children that there will be more toys, bottles, plates, cups in your home.</li>\n	<li>When the nanny gets vacations which would work for both families. Most nannies get between 2 weeks’ vacation and the days between Christmas and New Year. For the two weeks I always recommend that the families pick one week and the nanny picks the other week to make it fair.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Positives of being a part of a Nanny share</h4>\n<ul class=\"styled\">\n	<li>Sharing the cost of the nanny ages/ salary</li>\n	<li>The children learn to socialize with children their own age</li>\n	<li>Develop a close friendship with the other child</li>\n	<li>The children learn to share and participate with each other.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"controls\"><button class=\"btn\" onclick=\"document.location=\'families-sharing\';\">Families With A Shared Nanny</button><button class=\"btn\" onclick=\"document.location=\'families-looking\';\">Families Looking For A Shared Nanny</button></div>','Nanny Share Family Finder','','inherit','open','open','','115-autosave','','','2012-12-03 01:54:24','2012-12-03 01:54:24','',115,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/115-autosave/',0,'revision','',0),(138,1,'2012-11-19 20:40:22','2012-11-19 20:40:22','Welcome to the new Nanny Share Family Finder.

Most of the qualified and experienced nannies are Live-out nannies; they have their own homes, families to go back to at the end of each day.\r\n\r\n<strong>3.

An application form will then be emailed to you that you will need to fill out and email back. We use this to write job descriptions for the nannies to read and to help us get a sense of what you are looking for to make the match.\r\n\r\nAt Bumble Bees we like to conduct face to face meetings with families at a local café during the day so we can get a better idea of what the family needs are so we can match you with a nanny. We not only match by family requirements but also by personalities and interests.\r\n\r\n<strong>5.

During this process, we will keep in regular contact with you, updating you on the progress.\r\n\r\n<strong>6. Interview Process</strong>\r\n\r\nOnce Bumble Bees Nannies has found nannies that we think will suit what you are looking for, you will be emailed resumes to read through as well as our own personal thoughts about why the nanny would suit your family. If you are interested in the nannies, an interview will be setup. During this stage, a <a title=\"Fee Structure\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/families/fee-structure/\">Booking Fee</a> will be invoiced to you.\r\n\r\nOnce you have had your interviews and have decided on a  nanny, a Nanny Trial will be arranged. This is so that the family and nanny get to know each other before a job offer is made.\r\n\r\n<strong>7. Nanny Trials</strong>\r\n\r\nRichelle recommends a trial so that the family can see the nanny interact with the children and family and for the nanny to see how the parents interact with their children. It should be a relaxing time, so the nanny can settle in and feel comfortable. It is recommended that the family pay the nanny for this time, minimum wage and last between 3-4 hours or to 4-5 days, depending on how well you feel it is going.\r\n\r\n<strong>8. Final Steps</strong>\r\n\r\nOnce you have decided on a nanny then we can make a job offer to the nanny.

What your family needs from a childcare professional</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li> Do you need someone to help solely with your children or also run errands?</li>\r\n	<li>Do you need an extra pair of hands around the house to help with the children?</li>\r\n	<li>Does the child care professional need to be active and young at heart?</li>\r\n	<li>How many years experience would you like the nanny to have?</li>\r\n	<li>Is a driver necessary for school runs, after school activities or play dates?</li>\r\n	<li>Full or part time?</li>\r\n	<li>Would both parents be at work during the day so you need a very qualified nanny, with great communication skills?</li>\r\n	<li>Would you like your caregiver to have the same interests as you or your children?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>2. Shall I hire a Live-In or Live-Out Nanny?</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Live-In Nanny</strong>: The salary of a live-in nanny is lower because the food and accommodation is taken into account and there is extra room to accommodate the nanny (bedroom, living area, bathroom - which can be shared with the children). If a nanny lives with you, they need to have access to the kitchen and most areas of the house, tehy become a part of the family and a close bond with the nanny and family is usually developed quite quickly.\r\n\r\nA negative side to consider is the lack of privacy after hours and in weekends. Most nannies keep themselves busy and have a V in their living area, but they do need to share the kitchen and bathrooms with the family.\r\n\r\n<strong>Live-Out Nanny</strong>: There is a lack of space for a nanny to live with the family and the family want to keep their privacy, especially in the weekends and after hours. Most of the qualified and experienced nannies are live-out nannies, they have their own homes and families to go back to at the end of each day.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Contact Bumble Bees Nannies via Email or Phone</strong>\r\n\r\nFill in an <a title=\"Family Registration Form\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/family-registration/\">online form</a> with the basic details of your family needs and then we will contact you with further questions. Or email <a href=\"mailto:richelle@bumblebeesnannies.com\">Richelle</a> directly with a brief message on what you are looking for.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Application Forms</strong>\r\n\r\nOnce this has been done, we will call you to discuss your needs and answer any questions you may have. An application form will t hen be emailed to you that you will need to fill out and email back. We use this to write job descriptions for the nannies to read and to help us get a sense of what you are looking for to make the match.\r\n\r\nBumble Bees Nannies likes to conduct face to face meetings with families as well as nannies so they can get a better idea of the family so we can match you with a nanny, not only by interests and family requirements, but also by personalities.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Nanny Search</strong>\r\n\r\nOnce Bumble Bees Nannies has received the application form, she will start looking for nannies who suit your needs and wants. During this process, we will keep in regular contact with you, updating you on the progress.\r\n\r\n<strong>6. Interview Process</strong>\r\n\r\nOnce Bumble Bees Nannies has found nannies that we think will suit what you are looking for, you will be emailed resumes to read through as well as our own personal thoughts about why the nanny would suit your family. If you are interested in the nannies, then an interview will be setup. During this stage, a Booking Fee will be invoiced to you.\r\n\r\nOnce you have had your interviews and have decided on a  nanny, then a Nanny Trial will be arranged. This is so that the family and nanny get to know each other before a job offer is made.\r\n\r\n<strong>7. Nanny Trials</strong>\r\n\r\nRichelle recommends a trial so that the family can see the nanny interact with the children and family and for the nanny to see how the parents interact with their children. It should be a relaxing time, so the nanny can settle in and feel comfortable. It is recommended that the family pay the nanny for this time, minimum wage and last between 3-4 hours or to 4-5 days, depending on how well you feel it is going.\r\n\r\n<strong>8. Final Steps</strong>\r\n\r\nOnce you have decided on a nanny, then we can make a job offer to the nanny. If she accepts, then Bumble Bees Nannies will write a contract for you and the nanny can start.\r\n\r\nYou will receive a more descriptive \'Step-by-Step\' when we contact you so you know in detail how it works.','Families Step-By-Step','','inherit','open','open','','187-revision-2','','','2012-11-27 03:11:45','2012-11-27 03:11:45','',187,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/187-revision-2/',0,'revision','',0),(197,1,'2012-11-27 03:51:02','2012-11-27 03:51:02','<h4 id=\"live-out-nannies\">Live-Out Nannies</h4>\r\nLooking for someone to look after your child/children weekdays while you are at work?

A Bumble Bees Mother\'s Helper can work hours similar to a nanny or a part time or be temporary. A mother\'s help is someone who is newer to childcare, with more limited experience. They are not left in sole charge of children for extended periods - they are there to look after the children alongside the parents, or alone with the children for a limited time when the parents are busy. A mother\'s helper can help with household chores such as emptying the dishwasher, folding laundry and grocery shopping. The Mother\'s help duties can vary and will be agreed upon and clarified by contract, by both mother\'s help and employer. Mother\'s helpers generally do not provide housekeeping services.\n<h4>After School Care</h4>\nBumble Bees Nannies can provide quality After School Care.

If nannies have Early Childhood qualifications and/or at least 3 years experience, they will be asked to come into the agency to discuss their experiences, qualifications, philosophies on raising children and why they finished with their last employer. During this process we also discuss their interests, hobbies and their reason for becoming a nanny. I find this information important to make a great match with a  family.\r\n\r\nBumble Bees Nannies also checks:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>References</li>\r\n	<li>Valid First Aid and CPR certification</li>\r\n	<li>Up to date Police Check</li>\r\n	<li>Drivers License details and/or passport, birth certificate</li>\r\n	<li>Working status if they are not a Canadian citizen</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhile going through their resume/CV, we look for any loopholes/gaps that they have missed and find out why they have missed out certain areas.\r\n\r\nWith Bumble Bees Nannies doing this process, it will eliminate the amount of work you need to do and the amount of nannies calling you and coming into your home doing interviews. It can be confusing interviewing multiple candidates, so let Bumble Bees Nannies do all the work finding the right nanny for you. Bumble Bees Nannies aims for families to only interview 2-4 nannies which we think will suit all your needs and requirements.\r\n\r\nNannies who meet all Bumble Bees Nannies requirements will then be matched with appropriate families. With our extensive nanny screening process, we are confident that we can find the right nanny for your family.','Nanny Screening Process','','inherit','open','open','','164-revision-2','','','2012-11-23 03:18:01','2012-11-23 03:18:01','',164,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/164-revision-2/',0,'revision','',0),(270,1,'2012-11-27 04:16:15','2012-11-27 04:16:15','<ul>\r\n	<li>Written references from previous jobs and character references or phone numbers from at least two childcare positions</li>\r\n	<li>Photocopy of Birth Certificate, Passport and visa/work permit (if applicable)</li>\r\n	<li>Current First Aid and CPR certificate</li>\r\n	<li>Degree/Diploma or Certificate from all your courses</li>\r\n	<li>Two passport sized photos - smiling would be great</li>\r\n</ul>','Interview Information','','inherit','open','open','','210-revision-2','','','2012-11-27 04:16:15','2012-11-27 04:16:15','',210,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/210-revision-2/',0,'revision','',0),(271,1,'2012-11-27 04:01:39','2012-11-27 04:01:39','<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\">Register online for free - it just takes 2 minutes and attach your resume or email your resume directly to Richelle</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\">If you have enough experience or qualifications, Bumble Bees Nannies will email you an application form and interview times when we are available to meet you</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\">The application form needs to be filled out as descriptive as possible</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\">Once the interview has taken place, your references, passports and police/identity papers will be checked.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\">If all goes well, you will be contacted to become a Bumble Bees Nannies Childcare Professional</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"line-height: 13px;\">Bumble Bees Nannies will call or email you with potential opportunities</span></li>\r\n</ul>','Caregivers Step-By-Step','','inherit','open','open','','202-revision-2','','','2012-11-27 04:01:39','2012-11-27 04:01:39','',202,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/202-revision-2/',0,'revision','',0),(272,1,'2012-11-27 04:13:38','2012-11-27 04:13:38','<h4>Nanny, Nanny/Share</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>ECE or ECA or qualified nanny qualification (you must present this at the interview)</li>\r\n	<li>At least three years full-time Professional Childcare experience if you are not ECE qualified</li>\r\n	<li>At least two references</li>\r\n	<li>CPR and First Aid certificates</li>\r\n	<li>Recent Police check</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Mother\'s Helper</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>At least one year experience working with children as a babysitter, camp counselor</li>\r\n	<li>Shows maturity and a strong interest in working with children</li>\r\n	<li>Willingness to learn and listen to the mother or father</li>\r\n	<li>Open communicator</li>\r\n	<li>At least two references associated with childcare and/or a character reference (such as Course Lecturer/Head of Education)</li>\r\n	<li>CPR and First Aid certificates</li>\r\n	<li>Recent Police check</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>After School Care</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>At least one year experience working with children as a babysitter, camp counselor or studying at university (ECE, Nursing, Psychology)</li>\r\n	<li>Shows maturity and a strong interest in working with children</li>\r\n	<li>Ability to help with homework</li>\r\n	<li>Open communicator</li>\r\n	<li>At least two references associated with childcare and/or a character reference (such as Course Lecturer/Head of Education)</li>\r\n	<li>CPR and First Aid certificates</li>\r\n	<li>Recent Police check</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Emergency Babysitter</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Studying ECE/ECA or many years childcare experience</li>\r\n	<li>CPR and First Aid certificates</li>\r\n	<li>Recent Police check</li>\r\n	<li>Over 17 years old</li>\r\n</ul>','Requirements To Be A Bumble Bees Childcare Professional','','inherit','open','open','','205-revision-3','','','2012-11-27 04:13:38','2012-11-27 04:13:38','',205,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/205-revision-3/',0,'revision','',0),(273,1,'2012-11-27 03:36:17','2012-11-27 03:36:17','<strong>1.

Shall I hire a Live-In or Live-Out Nanny?</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Live-In Nanny</strong>: The salary of a live-in nanny is lower because the food and accommodation is taken into account and there is extra room to accommodate the nanny (bedroom, living area, bathroom - which can be shared with the children). If a nanny lives with you, they need to have access to the kitchen and most areas of the house, tehy become a part of the family and a close bond with the nanny and family is usually developed quite quickly.\r\n\r\nA negative side to consider is the lack of privacy after hours and in weekends. Most nannies keep themselves busy and have a V in their living area, but they do need to share the kitchen and bathrooms with the family.\r\n\r\n<strong>Live-Out Nanny</strong>: There is a lack of space for a nanny to live with the family and the family want to keep their privacy, especially in the weekends and after hours. Most of the qualified and experienced nannies are live-out nannies, they have their own homes and families to go back to at the end of each day.\r\n\r\n<strong>3.

Application Forms</strong>\r\n\r\nOnce this has been done, we will call you to discuss your needs and answer any questions you may have. An application form will t hen be emailed to you that you will need to fill out and email back. We use this to write job descriptions for the nannies to read and to help us get a sense of what you are looking for to make the match.\r\n\r\nBumble Bees Nannies likes to conduct face to face meetings with families as well as nannies so they can get a better idea of the family so we can match you with a nanny, not only by interests and family requirements, but also by personalities.\r\n\r\n<strong>5.

Interview Process</strong>\r\n\r\nOnce Bumble Bees Nannies has found nannies that we think will suit what you are looking for, you will be emailed resumes to read through as well as our own personal thoughts about why the nanny would suit your family. If you are interested in the nannies, then an interview will be setup. During this stage, a <a title=\"Fee Structure\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/families/fee-structure/\">Booking Fee</a> will be invoiced to you.\r\n\r\nOnce you have had your interviews and have decided on a  nanny, then a Nanny Trial will be arranged. This is so that the family and nanny get to know each other before a job offer is made.\r\n\r\n<strong>7. Nanny Trials</strong>\r\n\r\nRichelle recommends a trial so that the family can see the nanny interact with the children and family and for the nanny to see how the parents interact with their children. It should be a relaxing time, so the nanny can settle in and feel comfortable. It is recommended that the family pay the nanny for this time, minimum wage and last between 3-4 hours or to 4-5 days, depending on how well you feel it is going.\r\n\r\n<strong>8. Final Steps</strong>\r\n\r\nOnce you have decided on a nanny, then we can make a job offer to the nanny. If she accepts, then Bumble Bees Nannies will write a contract for you and the nanny can start.\r\n\r\nYou will receive a more descriptive \'Step-by-Step\' when we contact you so you know in detail how it works.','Families Step-By-Step','','inherit','open','open','','187-revision-3','','','2012-11-27 03:36:17','2012-11-27 03:36:17','',187,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/187-revision-3/',0,'revision','',0),(274,1,'2012-11-27 03:51:02','2012-11-27 03:51:02','<h4>Live-Out Nannies</h4>\r\nLooking for someone to look after your child/children weekdays while you are at work? A nanny may be the best option for you.\r\n\r\nA nanny can be full time, part time or temporary. Nannies are generally sole charge, meaning that they are the only caregiver present with your child/ren.\r\n\r\nFull-time Live-out nannies work around 8-10 hours a day, Monday - Friday. With a Live-Out Nanny, additional babysitting outside of the standard schedule can be provided by agreement or contract (at additional cost).\r\n\r\nBumble Bees Nannies have the qualifications you are looking for, including Early Childhood Education credits and years of childcare experience. A nanny can take care of a broad range of responsibilities, including just about everything related to your children:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Playing and Entertaining</li>\r\n	<li>Creating stimulating environments</li>\r\n	<li>Making sure that everything is age appropriate</li>\r\n	<li>Organizing play dates, sports and activities</li>\r\n	<li>Cleaning the children\'s rooms/bathrooms and toys</li>\r\n	<li>Helping with homework</li>\r\n	<li>Cooking for the children and associated kitchen cleanup</li>\r\n	<li>Organizing and taking children to their doctors/dentist/hair appointments</li>\r\n	<li>Children\'s laundry</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Mother\'s Help</h4>\r\nNeed an extra pair of hands to help you with your children during the day? A Bumble Bees Mother\'s Helper can work hours similar to a nanny or a part time or be temporary. A mother\'s help is someone who is newer to childcare, with more limited experience. They are not left in sole charge of children for extended periods - they are there to look after the children alongside the parents, or alone with the children for a limited time when the parents are busy. A mother\'s helper can help with household chores such as emptying the dishwasher, folding laundry and grocery shopping. The Mother\'s help duties can vary and will be agreed upon and clarified by contract, by both mother\'s help and employer. Mother\'s helpers generally do not provide housekeeping services.\r\n<h4>After School Care</h4>\r\nBumble Bees Nannies can provide quality After School Care. They will pick up your children from school, organize after school activities, help children with their homework, cook dinner and make sure all information from school is given to parents.\r\n\r\nWe usually try and place daycare teachers who have morning jobs or university students who are completing their degrees, ECE diplomas, Nursing students, psychology that are looking to work as After School Nannies to earn extra money.\r\n\r\nNanny Share\r\n\r\nCheck our <a title=\"Nanny Share Family Finder\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/nanny-share/\">Nanny Share</a> section for more information.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Childcare Options','','inherit','open','open','','197-revision-2','','','2012-11-27 03:51:02','2012-11-27 03:51:02','',197,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/197-revision-2/',0,'revision','',0),(275,1,'2012-12-01 21:44:33','2012-12-01 21:44:33','Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

It can also disrupt the nannies routine and schedule especially when children’s items are forgotten eg winter hats and gloves, sunscreen, bottles.\r\n\r\n<h4>Points to consider when starting a Nanny Share</h4>\r\n<ul class=\"styled\">\r\n	<li>The household where the children will be based will need to have an extra sleeping area and bed (pack and play)</li>\r\n	<li>The cost of children’s groceries will need to be halved ie. milk, food, diapers, wipes</li>\r\n	<li>Transport for two children, whether it be two car seats or a double stroller if needed.</li>\r\n	<li>Transporting your child’s bottles every morning and afternoon or buying an extra set for the other house</li>\r\n	<li>For the house that is having the children that there will be more toys, bottles, plates, cups in your home.</li>\r\n	<li>When the nanny gets vacations which would work for both families. Most nannies get between 2 weeks’ vacation and the days between Christmas and New Year. For the two weeks I always recommend that the families pick one week and the nanny picks the other week to make it fair.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Positives of being a part of a Nanny share</h4>\r\n<ul class=\"styled\">\r\n	<li>Sharing the cost of the nanny ages/ salary</li>\r\n	<li>The children learn to socialize with children their own age</li>\r\n	<li>Develop a close friendship with the other child</li>\r\n	<li>The children learn to share and participate with each other.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"controls\">\r\n<button class=\"btn\" onclick=\"document.location=\'families-sharing\';\">Families With A Shared Nanny</button><button class=\"btn\" onclick=\"document.location=\'families-looking\';\">Families Looking For A Shared Nanny</button>\r\n</div>','Nanny Share Family Finder','','inherit','open','open','','115-revision-17','','','2012-12-01 22:09:12','2012-12-01 22:09:12','',115,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/115-revision-17/',0,'revision','',0),(287,1,'2012-11-30 04:29:39','2012-11-30 04:29:39','What is the screening process for nannies joining Bumble Bees Nannies?\r\n\r\nAt Bumble Bees Nannies, all nanny applicants are required to submit their updated resume, as well as an application form.

A nanny may be the best option for you.\r\n\r\nA nanny can be full time, part time or temporary. Nannies are generally sole charge, meaning that they are the only caregiver present with your child/ren.\r\n\r\nFull-time Live-out nannies work around 8-10 hours a day, Monday - Friday. With a Live-Out Nanny, additional babysitting outside of the standard schedule can be provided by agreement or contract (at additional cost).\r\n\r\nBumble Bees Nannies have the qualifications you are looking for, including Early Childhood Education credits and years of childcare experience. A nanny can take care of a broad range of responsibilities, including just about everything related to your children:\r\n<ul class=\"styled\">\r\n	<li>Playing and Entertaining</li>\r\n	<li>Creating stimulating environments</li>\r\n	<li>Making sure that everything is age appropriate</li>\r\n	<li>Organizing play dates, sports and activities</li>\r\n	<li>Cleaning the children\'s rooms/bathrooms and toys</li>\r\n	<li>Helping with homework</li>\r\n	<li>Cooking for the children and associated kitchen cleanup</li>\r\n	<li>Organizing and taking children to their doctors/dentist/hair appointments</li>\r\n	<li>Children\'s laundry</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4 id=\"mothers-help\">Mother\'s Help</h4>\r\nNeed an extra pair of hands to help you with your children during the day? A Bumble Bees Mother\'s Helper can work hours similar to a nanny or a part time or be temporary. A mother\'s help is someone who is newer to childcare, with more limited experience. They are not left in sole charge of children for extended periods - they are there to look after the children alongside the parents, or alone with the children for a limited time when the parents are busy. A mother\'s helper can help with household chores such as emptying the dishwasher, folding laundry and grocery shopping. The Mother\'s help duties can vary and will be agreed upon and clarified by contract, by both mother\'s help and employer. Mother\'s helpers generally do not provide housekeeping services.\r\n<h4 id=\"after-school-care\">After School Care</h4>\r\nBumble Bees Nannies can provide quality After School Care. They will pick up your children from school, organize after school activities, help children with their homework, cook dinner and make sure all information from school is given to parents.\r\n\r\nWe usually try and place daycare teachers who have morning jobs or university students who are completing their degrees, ECE diplomas, Nursing students, psychology that are looking to work as After School Nannies to earn extra money.\r\n\r\n<h4 id=\"nanny-share\">Nanny Share</h4>\r\n\r\nCheck our <a title=\"Nanny Share Family Finder\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/nanny-share/\">Nanny Share</a> section for more information.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Childcare Options','','inherit','open','open','','197-revision-4','','','2012-12-01 22:25:10','2012-12-01 22:25:10','',197,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/197-revision-4/',0,'revision','',0),(312,1,'2012-11-28 03:12:54','2012-11-28 03:12:54','Here are the job vacancies, with the text that goes along describing the jobs...','Job Vacancies','','inherit','open','open','','21-revision-6','','','2012-11-28 03:12:54','2012-11-28 03:12:54','',21,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/21-revision-6/',0,'revision','',0),(313,1,'2012-12-02 02:34:22','2012-12-02 02:34:22','Here is the Job Vacancies description, with the text that goes along describing the jobs...\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Full Time\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/job-vacancies/full-time/\">Full Time</a>\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Part Time\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/job-vacancies/part-time/\">Part Time</a>\r\n\r\n<a title=\"After School Care\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/job-vacancies/after-school-care/\">After School Care</a>','Job Vacancies','','inherit','open','open','','21-revision-7','','','2012-12-02 02:34:22','2012-12-02 02:34:22','',21,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/21-revision-7/',0,'revision','',0),(314,1,'2012-12-02 02:35:03','2012-12-02 02:35:03','Here is the Job Vacancies description, with the text that goes along describing the jobs...\r\n\r\n<a class=\"btn\" title=\"Full Time\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/job-vacancies/full-time/\">Full Time</a>\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Part Time\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/job-vacancies/part-time/\">Part Time</a>\r\n\r\n<a title=\"After School Care\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/job-vacancies/after-school-care/\">After School Care</a>','Job Vacancies','','inherit','open','open','','21-revision-8','','','2012-12-02 02:35:03','2012-12-02 02:35:03','',21,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/21-revision-8/',0,'revision','',0),(315,1,'2012-12-02 02:35:29','2012-12-02 02:35:29','Here is the Job Vacancies description, with the text that goes along describing the jobs...\r\n\r\n<div class=\"controls\">\r\n<a class=\"btn\" title=\"Full Time\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/job-vacancies/full-time/\">Full Time</a>\r\n\r\n<a class=\"btn\" title=\"Part Time\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/job-vacancies/part-time/\">Part Time</a>\r\n\r\n<a class=\"btn\" title=\"After School Care\" href=\"http://localhost/bumblebees/job-vacancies/after-school-care/\">After School Care</a>\r\n</div>','Job Vacancies','','inherit','open','open','','21-revision-9','','','2012-12-02 02:35:29','2012-12-02 02:35:29','',21,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/21-revision-9/',0,'revision','',0),(316,1,'2012-12-02 02:39:10','2012-12-02 02:39:10','Here is where you contact Bumble Bees Nannies to get in touch with a particular family.','Contact Family','','publish','open','open','','contact-family','','','2012-12-02 02:39:10','2012-12-02 02:39:10','',21,'http://localhost/bumblebees/?page_id=316',0,'page','',0),(317,1,'2012-12-02 02:39:03','2012-12-02 02:39:03','','Contact Family','','inherit','open','open','','316-revision','','','2012-12-02 02:39:03','2012-12-02 02:39:03','',316,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/316-revision/',0,'revision','',0),(318,1,'2012-11-11 18:47:52','2012-11-11 18:47:52','Here\'s some introduction to the caregivers registration form page.

There is usually only 1 child from each family in this option.\r\n<strong>Option 2:</strong> The nanny alternates between caring for one family’s children on one day, and the other family’s children on the other days.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"divider div3\"></div>\r\n\r\nWith a nanny share, the families involved should have the same philosophies on parenting, routines, discipline, etc. In most nanny shares, the involved families have one child each. Nanny share nannies usually work between 45- 50 hours per week.\r\n\r\nMany families would like to alternate between the two houses, 1-2 weeks in each home. If this is done it could unsettle the children and disrupt their routine. Consistency is very important for young children. It can also disrupt the nannies routine and schedule especially when children’s items are forgotten eg winter hats and gloves, sunscreen, bottles.\r\n\r\n<h4>Points to consider when starting a Nanny Share</h4>\r\n<ul class=\"styled\">\r\n	<li>The household where the children will be based will need to have an extra sleeping area and bed (pack and play)</li>\r\n	<li>The cost of children’s groceries will need to be halved ie. milk, food, diapers, wipes</li>\r\n	<li>Transport for two children, whether it be two car seats or a double stroller if needed.</li>\r\n	<li>Transporting your child’s bottles every morning and afternoon or buying an extra set for the other house</li>\r\n	<li>For the house that is having the children that there will be more toys, bottles, plates, cups in your home.</li>\r\n	<li>When the nanny gets vacations which would work for both families. Most nannies get between 2 weeks’ vacation and the days between Christmas and New Year. For the two weeks I always recommend that the families pick one week and the nanny picks the other week to make it fair.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Positives of being a part of a Nanny share</h4>\r\n<ul class=\"styled\">\r\n	<li>Sharing the cost of the nanny ages/ salary</li>\r\n	<li>The children learn to socialize with children their own age</li>\r\n	<li>Develop a close friendship with the other child</li>\r\n	<li>The children learn to share and participate with each other.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"controls\">\r\n<button class=\"btn\" onclick=\"document.location=\'families-sharing\';\">Families With A Shared Nanny</button><button class=\"btn\" onclick=\"document.location=\'families-looking\';\">Families Looking For A Shared Nanny</button>\r\n</div>','Nanny Share Family Finder','','inherit','open','open','','115-revision-18','','','2012-12-02 00:47:41','2012-12-02 00:47:41','',115,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/115-revision-18/',0,'revision','',0),(332,1,'2012-12-03 01:56:22','2012-12-03 01:56:22','<h4>RichelleAssenberg - Owner</h4>\r\nBumble Bees Nannies is owned and operated by RichelleAssenberg, a qualified Early Childhood Teacher and childcare professional with 12 years Early Childhood experience.

She was in contact with me throughout the experience and she matched me with a family that matched me perfectly. I have never been happier with my work. Richelle really worked with me to find me the hours, the family, the kids and even the area that suited my wants as well as my needs. She was quick to reply to emails or phone calls which I really appreciated as I needed a job in a very short period of time and she was able to find me an appropriate family in about a month. I love working for my family and they have really welcomed me into their home. I think it\'s Richelle\'s personal touch in each placement that makes the placements work so amazingly. She really got to know me so that she could see which families I would fit with and where my skills would be best used. My family is so great I actually miss my work kids on my days off and look forward to Monday when I can go play with my girls again.

There is usually only 1 child from each family in this option.\r\n<strong>Option 2:</strong> The nanny alternates between caring for one family’s children on one day, and the other family’s children on the other days.\r\n<div class=\"divider div3\"></div>\r\nWith a nanny share, the families involved should have the same philosophies on parenting, routines, discipline, etc. In most nanny shares, the involved families have one child each. Nanny share nannies usually work between 45- 50 hours per week.\r\n\r\nMany families would like to alternate between the two houses, 1-2 weeks in each home. This can unsettle the children and disrupt their routine. Consistency is very important for young children. It can also disrupt the nannies schedule especially when children’s items are left at the other home eg favourite toy, winter hats and gloves, sunscreen, bottles.\r\n<h4>Points to consider when starting a Nanny Share</h4>\r\n<ul class=\"styled\">\r\n	<li>The household where the children will be based will need to have an extra sleeping area and bed (pack and play)</li>\r\n	<li>The cost of children’s groceries will need to be halved ie. milk, food, diapers, wipes</li>\r\n	<li>Transport for two children, whether it be two car seats or a double stroller if needed.</li>\r\n	<li>Transporting your child’s bottles every morning and afternoon or buying an extra set for the other house</li>\r\n	<li>For the house that is having the children that there will be more toys, bottles, plates, cups in your home.</li>\r\n	<li>When the nanny gets vacations which would work for both families. Most nannies get between 2 weeks’ vacation and the days between Christmas and New Year. For the two weeks I always recommend that the families pick one week and the nanny picks the other week to make it fair.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Positives of being a part of a Nanny share</h4>\r\n<ul class=\"styled\">\r\n	<li>Sharing the cost of the nanny ages/ salary</li>\r\n	<li>The children learn to socialize with children their own age</li>\r\n	<li>Develop a close friendship with the other child</li>\r\n	<li>The children learn to share and participate with each other.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"controls\"><button class=\"btn\" onclick=\"document.location=\'families-sharing\';\">Families With A Shared Nanny</button><button class=\"btn\" onclick=\"document.location=\'families-looking\';\">Families Looking For A Shared Nanny</button></div>','Nanny Share Family Finder','','inherit','open','open','','115-revision-19','','','2012-12-03 01:53:23','2012-12-03 01:53:23','',115,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/115-revision-19/',0,'revision','',0),(365,1,'2012-12-03 02:33:07','2012-12-03 02:33:07','','Blog','','publish','open','open','','blog','','','2012-12-03 02:51:50','2012-12-03 02:51:50','',0,'http://localhost/bumblebees/?page_id=365',0,'page','',0),(366,1,'2012-12-03 02:32:54','2012-12-03 02:32:54','','Blog','','inherit','open','open','','365-revision','','','2012-12-03 02:32:54','2012-12-03 02:32:54','',365,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/365-revision/',0,'revision','',0),(367,1,'2012-12-03 02:38:46','0000-00-00 00:00:00','','Auto Draft','','auto-draft','open','open','','','','','2012-12-03 02:38:46','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://localhost/bumblebees/?page_id=367',0,'page','',0),(368,1,'2012-12-03 02:39:16','0000-00-00 00:00:00','','Auto Draft','','auto-draft','open','open','','','','','2012-12-03 02:39:16','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://localhost/bumblebees/?page_id=368',0,'page','',0),(369,1,'2012-12-03 02:33:07','2012-12-03 02:33:07','','Blog','','inherit','open','open','','365-revision-2','','','2012-12-03 02:33:07','2012-12-03 02:33:07','',365,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/365-revision-2/',0,'revision','',0),(370,1,'2012-12-03 02:48:16','2012-12-03 02:48:16',' ','','','publish','open','open','','370','','','2012-12-06 02:04:53','2012-12-06 02:04:53','',0,'http://localhost/bumblebees/?p=370',3,'nav_menu_item','',0),(371,1,'2012-12-03 02:39:32','2012-12-03 02:39:32','','Blog','','inherit','open','open','','365-revision-3','','','2012-12-03 02:39:32','2012-12-03 02:39:32','',365,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/365-revision-3/',0,'revision','',0),(372,1,'2012-12-03 02:48:38','2012-12-03 02:48:38','','Blog','','inherit','open','open','','365-revision-4','','','2012-12-03 02:48:38','2012-12-03 02:48:38','',365,'http://localhost/bumblebees/blog/365-revision-4/',0,'revision','',0),(373,1,'2012-12-03 03:25:57','2012-12-03 03:25:57','Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Richelle was immediately helpful and warm and took note of our special needs. All her applicants were wonderful, a step up from the other nannies we had interviewed. Ultimately, we have been extremely happy with our lovely nanny and our son definitely gives her a high five”\r\n- <strong>J.O- Mother from Leslieville</strong>\r\n\r\n“Bumble Bees Nannies were very knowledgeable and helpful when it came to finding someone for our nanny share position. Being a first-time parent, I was intimidated by the prospect of having to find a nanny to care for my son and my friend\'s daughter. Not only did they answer our many questions, but they were also able to find us a nanny that is a truly wonderful fit with both families. Our children enjoy spending time with her and we have peace of mind knowing that they are getting quality care every day. Thank you Bumble Bees Nannies!”\r\n- <strong>J.H Mother from East Toronto</strong>\r\n\r\n“Bumble Bees Nannies took the daunting task of finding the right childcare and made it simple! Richelle was such a tremendous help to my friend and I who were searching for a nanny to do a share with. We simply communicated what we were looking for and Richelle presented us with 3 women to interview and all were wonderful. We now have a fantastic nanny who is loving and interactive with our children and the kids adore her! A great service for busy parents who want the best for their family”\r\n- <strong>S.P Toronto</strong>\r\n\r\n“Great Nanny Agency! The service that we received from Richelle at Bumble Bees Nannies was unlike any other nanny agency that we have dealt with in Toronto. Previous agencies had just sent us nanny after nanny which we had to interview to find out that they were not fit with our family. Bumble Bees Nannies listened to our needs as a family and worked to find us the right nanny from the start. Richelle only had to send us 2 nannies to interview before we found the perfect match and that is all down to her hard work in the background. This saved us time and money.

She came to us 2 months after she had arrived from New Zealand, where during these 2 months she was temping for a family of three children. We have two children, Sebastian (Baz) and Chloe. At her time of joining us, they were 2 and half years and 7 months respectively.\r\n\r\nHaving had the same nanny since Baz was 16 weeks old,Richelle’s first priority was to spend time with our departing nanny, to ensure a ‘smooth and consistent’ hand-over of both our children’s routines. In what turned out to be a challenging situation at times, Richelle embraced this’ hand over’ with such openness, optimism and most importantly, enthusiasm, that we quickly knew we were really fortunate to have found a brilliant child carer.\r\n\r\nWithin weeks, Richelle had put her own personal stamp on the children’s routines, such as good, healthy eating, consistent sleeping patterns and most importantly, developing their social lives further.\r\n\r\nRichelle leads a very healthy lifestyle, which has impacted on Baz and Chloe. They prefer, fresh meat, fruit and vegetables to ‘fast food’ and she cooks fresh meals everyday, including a balance of meat and fish. Richelle has also introduced other nationalities into their ‘likes’ such as Chinese, Indian and Dutch delicacies!\r\n\r\nRichelle is naturally a very active, outdoor-orientated person. She has enjoyed a family gym membership, whilst with us, and through this, she has encouraged the children to get involved in weekly swimming, tennis, football and ballet lessons. Due to her own disposition, Richelle has regularly encouraged the children to try new experiences, such as skiing, boogie boarding and bungie jumping.\r\n\r\nRichelle is an extremely sociable person. She feels completely at ease talking to strangers at the children’s clubs, at the many family events we have included her in over the years and most importantly at the school gates with all the other mothers. In fact I would go as far to say that most of the mothers of my children’s friends regularly comment on what am amazing nanny Richelle is and how lucky we are – which of course we already know!\r\n\r\nNow that Baz is 6 and half years and Chloe is 4 and half years, Richelle’s priorities during term time have changed to a stronger focus on helping them with their homework. Our son is taking his prep-school entrance exams in October 2008. Richelle’s approach has been to guide them to finding the answers themselves, if she has to tell them something, she tries to focus on telling them once. This has enabled them to remember what they have learnt for themselves. As a result, my son (the youngest in his class) is now in the top stream in maths and on an accelerated reading programme. Both the Children’s teachers have complimented us on Richelle’s homework techniques\r\n\r\nAs I travel so much with my job, we were looking for someone, that was not just a nanny, but someone that would be very much part of our family. It goes without saying that Richelle is the fifth member of our family! She has accompanied us on many family holidays, both with other family friends and with the bigger Butterwick clan (grandparents, cousins etc). Richelle has got on really well with all of them, however these situations have often required her to adapt her style to accommodate other families living preferences.\r\n\r\nRichelle has been both a nanny, surrogate mother and dear friend to all of us. When our sonBaz, was 4 years old she took him to Paris on a sight-seeing trip, by themselves.\r\n\r\nI know she will continue to be very much part of our family and in the years to come we know the children will able to go and stay with her where ever her home is.
